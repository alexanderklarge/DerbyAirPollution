            	<br><br>
    	        Hi there! 
    	        My name's Alex and I'm analysing the air pollution data from Derby's sole AURN sensor.
    	        <br><br>
    	        If you have any <strong>questions</strong> or <strong>feature requests</strong> feel free to get in touch! 
    	        <br><br>
    	        For more information about the data and this project see the <a href="about.html"><strong>About</strong></a> page.
                <br><br>
                I've also been sharing the graphs from this project at @derbyairpollution on Instagram, but thought it'd be worth building a quick website too.

        <h2> Information About The Data </h2>
        <ul>
        	<li> The data is from the <strong>DEFRA</strong> (Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs) <a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/interactive-map"><strong>Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) map</strong></a> </li>
        	<li> The sensor takes <strong>hourly</strong> readings, and the DEFRA website updates with a new .csv file at the end of every day </li>
        	<li> The sensor measures levels of <strong>Nitric Oxide</strong> and <strong>Nitrogen Dioxide</strong>. Other sensors also measure methane, PM2.5s etc, but sadly the Derby sensor doesn't.</li>
        	<li> The sensor has been operational since the <strong>22nd of January 2017</strong>
        	<li> <strong>Python</strong> code to clean the raw data and output various graphs (the <strong>GitHub</strong> repo of code used to make the below graphs & this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/alexanderklarge/DerbyAirPollution"><strong>here</strong></a>) </li>
        </ul>

        <!--Graph 1 and 2-->
        <h2> Weekly 2020 Pollution vs Mean and Median of Previous Years</h2>
        <p> The below 2 graphs show the total weekly pollution of 2020 compared to the mean (average) and median (middle, more reliable than the mean) of the previous 3 years of data, to help compare 2020 to what is "normal".</p>
        
        <div class="sidebyside">
            <img class="side" src="Images/05. Weekly 2020 Pollution VS Mean and Median Full.png" alt="Weekly 2020 Derby Pollution VS Mean and Median"/>

        <hr/>

        <!--Graph 3 and 4-->
        <h2> Total Weekly Pollution, Comparing Each Year</h2>
        <p> The below graphs show all 4 years worth of data plotted together. This is useful as you can see the value for each year, but it is much harder to assess general trends, which is why graphs 1 and 2 are more useful at-a-glance.</p>
        
        <div class="sidebyside">
            <img class="side" src="Images/02. Weekly Pollution All Years.png"/>

        </div>
        <hr/>

        <!--Graph 6-->
        <h2> 2020 Weekly Total Pollution As % of Median of Previous Years</h2>
        <p> If we take the median value of each week as the "normal" value for pollution for that week, we can then compare the 2020 value and see whether it is higher or lower than "normal".</p>

        <hr/>

        <!--Graph 5-->
        <h2> Hourly Pollution In The 4 Week Window Immediately After Lockdown</h2>
        <p> The lockdown was officially announced on the 23rd of March, 2020. It is useful to compare the 4-week window from the lockdown (23/3/2020 - 19/4/2020) to the same window of previous years, to get a basic idea of the effect of the lockdown.</p>

        <!--Graph 7 & 8-->
        <h2> Monthly 2020 Pollution VS Median Of Previous Years</h2>
        <p> Comparing the total measured pollution in each month of 2020 to the median of previous years </p>
        
        <div class="sidebyside">

        </div>
        <br/><!-- This adds a line break-->

        <p> The below graph shows that March was ~65% the "normal" pollution we'd expect, and April was ~35%! I.e. April saw a drop of 65% compared to a previous Aprils on record.</p>

        <!--Graph 9 and 10-->
        <h2> Average Hourly Pollution Per Day and Quarter</h2>
        <p> The final two graphs are just quick ones to look at overall trends in the whole dataset </p>
